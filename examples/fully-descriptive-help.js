Sample app.

 Group 1:
  arg1                        aaaa
  arg2                        bbbb

 Group 2:
  -a, --aa                    aaaa
  -b, --bb                    bbbb

This is a random paragraph. You can add descriptive messages very easily with
the paragraph() function.
Remember that all the messages are line-wrapped at 80 columns and you can use \n
to split them in multiple lines...

...or if you want to print a new paragraph use the paragraph() function again.
Line messages differs from paragraph messages in that
they begin in a new line (\n) and paragraphs
begin in a new paragraph (\n\n)

Do you still need more printing functions? Check this:
  this is column 1            This is a multiline in
                                column 2

 Informational options:
  -h, --help                  Display this help message and exit
  -v, --version               Output version information and exit

The program exits with a status code of 0 if no error, otherwise 1.
